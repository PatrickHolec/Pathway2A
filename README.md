# Pathway2A
This MATLAB tool is designed to optimize the arrangement of polycistronic gene expression in eukaryotes

Hey!

So if you want to try out this tool for yourself, download the three files hanging out in this folder (permpos.m, Pathway2A.fig, and Pathway2A.m). Once you have them all downloaded, you can  open the file with MATLAB. This will lead you to the GUI which you can play with. To get your simulation results:

1. Execute script
2. Select the number of enzymes in your biochemical pathway
3. Fill in expected kcat/km values
4. (Optional) Change the production ratio (between 0 and 1) 
5. Simulate!
